## Research Interests

My main research topic is Late Prehistory and Protohistory (Early Neolithic to Final Bronze Age) of Mediterranean and Western Europe, with particular interest for ancient iconography. I develop IT methods to manage data and knowledge representations. 

### Geographic Areas

Western Europe, Mediterranean, Middle East, North Africa

## Research Profile

Since my PhD on Alpine rock-art (2006-12), I was employed as a Study Engineer at the Cartographic department of the Université de Bourgogne (2013-14); Researcher at the UMR 5340, ASM-CNRS, Université Montpellier 3 (2015-16); Research Engineer at the UMR 7264, CEPAM-CNRS, Université Nice  Sophia-Antipolis (2018); Researcher and Database Manager at the commercial Archaïos company (2019-20); Specialist Research Support Technician at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (2020-21). I joined the School of Archaeology and the EAMENA project in late 2021 as Researcher and Database Manager.
I manage programming languages, data acquisition (DGPS, remote sensing, 3D, etc.), data structure and integration (database, server, Git, etc.), data extraction and processing with scripted routines, data analysis with statistics and geostatistics, data modeling (network analysis, interactive maps and graphs, web3D, etc.), and data publication (data-driven document, authoring framework for data science, FAIR data, etc.).
